# Motivation for using a CNN
Two main reasons for using CNNs instead of MLPs when working with image data: <br/><br/>

1. To use MLPs with images, we need to flatten the image. If we do so, spatial information (relationships between the nearby pixels) will be lost. So, accuracy will be reduced significantly. <br/><br/>
2. CNNs can retain spatial information as they take the images in the original format.
CNNs can reduce the number of parameters in the network significantly. So, CNNs are parameter efficient.
